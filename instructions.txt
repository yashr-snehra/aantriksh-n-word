Once they pay they can upload their shit,
 we make a page for them to display their
 NFTs and then they can upload their shit 
to service LIKE DROPBOX if not Dropbox a 
custom filesystem through which we read 
data and display as stickers on the said 
page for end users

Download the Program or discord bot. Add your projects policy id, so we have the collection. After that, add the link to the extra layers and boom…everything is set up and everyone can use it. 

Founders pay a small fee monthly to use it. 

That is how we could generate monthly income. I would suggest that we think in general about options like that. Like that you could easily earn some hundred ada per month.

Origin of the pfp
The origin of the files should be from a external source like 
https://pool.pm/asset1r5vcyd5xf80p6nqztnh9ujek6zd02u857yx003
or
https://cnft.tools/chilledkongs
or whatever is better
3. The source of the additional files should be the Dropbox service. The host creates a folder 
there, containing all the files. Each folder may include different types of files, similar to the 
example. Additionally, each folder contains multiple versions of the same extra file, reflecting 
various fur colors.
We aim to produce more of these extra files over time. Every time we're satisfied with a new 
one, I simply create a new folder on Dropbox and drag-and-drop the new file into it. The 
website automatically receives a new folder, allowing users to work with it instantly
. Fur and Metadata
As mentioned earlier, each folder can contain more than just one file. This happens, for 
instance, when there's colored fur involved. When the user inputs the NFT number, the 
program should also check the necessary metadata, such as fur color or, in this example, the 
breed. In the Dropbox folder, it will search for the correct breed name and select that file
